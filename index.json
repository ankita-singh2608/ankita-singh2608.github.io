[{"categories":null,"contents":"Approximately two years ago, I, with a couple more friends, attempted to start something of our own in the event management industry, which fortunately or unfortunately, failed. Throughout my entrepreneurship course, I have constantly been looking for answers and improvements I could have done during my last startup experience and something that I am eagerly waiting to apply in my future.\nSo I made a note of the following from my course, as I know these are the most practical and important steps to turn that dream into reality. It follows a lean-startup model methodology, where basically it allows you to fail early and pivot quickly rather than failing later. Here you go :\nProblem statement: Begin by clearly defining the problem statement. There’s nothing worse than a vague problem statement – separate it from your idea always. You need this to ensure it is a pain killer and not a vitamin to build your MVP(Minimal Viable Product, a term used by entrepreneurs quite frequently).\nThe last time I wasn’t successful in my business idea was because I was so absorbed with the idea of creating something in the event management world, that I forgot what problem I was really solving. This also will motivate us to keep going during tough times – “Start with why” – sometimes it is all that you need to inspire yourself to keep going.\nCustomer discovery: There is nothing more painful than creating a product or service that no one cares about. Maybe you have the best idea, but do the customers really care about it? This is going to take multiple rounds of discovery so be patient. Talk to as many people as possible, grow your sample size. I would definitely refer back to the book “Talking to Humans”- it has the best approach to speak to your potential customers. The most important learning is to ask open-ended questions and avoid advertising your idea in the initial customer discovery phases.\nFail early and pivot: I know this is the most difficult point, but there’s a fair chance that we find ourselves in a position, after doing the customer discovery, that the product does not fit the market very well. Other times, our idea would already have been executed by another organization before we did. In situations like these, do pivot. Keep refining the product/service as long as it takes to fit the market demands exactly. It is better to fail early via customer discovery phases and pivoting rather than actually failing later after investing a lot of finances and time that wasn’t worth it.\nDesign Thinking \u0026amp; Creating Personas: This is the most creative part and the one that I love! While market segmentation, it is very tempting to keep expanding your product features to include more and more customers. It only increases the risk of failure as you would not be concentrating on the needs of clearly defined market requirements – resulting in features of the product not solving anyone’s problem. I would remind myself – ‘Please do not be greedy by trying to capture all the market’. Create a clear market segmentation and define your personas. Follow the steps of design thinking : empathy -\u0026gt; define -\u0026gt; ideate -\u0026gt;prototype -\u0026gt; test. The tools to create personas using interaction design techniques have been very helpful and super fun during my entrepreneurship project(you can find a ton of tools online that could design a visual of your persona).\nEarly phase financing: This is something I have struggled with earlier as well. Do ensure to clearly layout the finances needed and forecast the costs. Before looking for investments, trying to fund it ourselves through savings or through side hustle is a wise choice. Reaching out to friends and family before reaching out to banks and venture capitalists is also a choice. But be very sure that this phase only comes after the customer discovery phase, so that you are investing in something worth the time, effort and costs.\nDuring investment pitches, we might be offered finances in return of certain shares of the company. Also, we might be reluctant to do so, but remember that it is more important to grow the pie. Forget the fixed pie concept and instead focus on increasing the pie size so that no matter what small piece you have, you still get the most out of it.\nPartnership: Make wise decisions while creating a partnership. We are always leaned towards making our best friends as partners – but think twice. The best partner will be someone who complements your skills – if I know finance is not my strength, or I lack some experience in the industry I am entering, then I will find a partner who fills these gaps. There is nothing wrong to have paperwork in place even if you enter this business with your best friend. Clarify it all in the beginning and be prepared for any situation that could go wrong. The other aspect of this is to let go of people not contributing to the business’s growth. It will be hard, but it will be the best decision for both our company and them in the long run.\nIt’s about the journey, more than the destination: Remember, when you get into this process, you will have to go all-in as you progress. Informing the family and closest friends about the hustle is important. They need to accept and understand this situation. The greatest strength and support will come from them. I remember having a slight reluctance from my mom when I started working on my first startup idea. And it is important to have those crucial conversations and explain to them why it is important to you.\nThe most important part of this is the journey itself. There is joy in this process. Often, focusing only on the final destination could be tiring. So enjoy the journey, the ups and the downs, the highs and lows – because it is something you will always cherish for life. The most we learn and grow is when we are walking through these phases.\n","permalink":"https://ankita-singh2608.github.io/blog/post-6/","tags":null,"title":"MBA diaries: What would I do differently as an entrepreneur?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"There have been tons of articles and videos on how to stay fit, why is it important and how to do it right but no one says for what reasons you should start.\nWhen fitness comes to our mind, we cannot help but have an image associated with our definition of fitness: Jennifer Aniston or Tom Cruise or a particular body image pops up in our head. Do you know why our new year resolution to stay fit goes down the drain within the first few weeks? It is because our definition of fitness has been distorted all these years. I am sorry to break this to you, but I believe the desire to have a particular physique compared to famous personalities, is not the best way to get started on your fitness goals.\nSo then, what is fitness?\nI would say, it’s a state of our overall being when we feel completely balanced in all dimensions of our life - physically, mentally and emotionally. If you begin working out with the goal of staying active all day, something that helps you manage your stress levels, helps you focus better, improves how your body functions, makes you feel stronger yet calmer, improves your sleep, and most importantly makes you feel happy and energized all day long, it is most likely that you are going to work out consistently in the long-run. When we begin working out with an image in our mind, it is most likely that it takes months or sometimes years to get to that point and it soon discourages us if we do not see any change in our physical appearance. That is the point when we lose patience, get discouraged and give up soon. So I invite you to rather, work out with the aim of feeling better every day and focusing your observation on overall changes instead of measuring changes in physical appearance. And trust me, if you are consistent, one day, “your physical fitness appearance” will follow too. But it is not sustainable in the long-run if you start with your physical appearance in mind.\nIf you have been thinking for long about regularly working out, I would encourage you to choose any fitness activity of your choice(walking, running, yoga, dancing) and observe how you feel every day when you work out. Notice your thoughts and any difference in your study and work behaviour. Once you feel the changes within yourself, you would automatically be motivated to work out the next day, and then the day after, and so on. Even before you know, you would have built it in your daily routine and this time for the right reasons.\nHaving said that, you may argue it is lockdown so how should one start and stay motivated? Begin with 10 mins of any activity in the first week. And gradually increase the time. Workout with your friend on a video call if possible. If you need to hear an inspirational story, my friend @Sanika has been working out with me on a video call every day and she has been more consistent with her workout schedule during lockdown than she was ever in her life before! I am so proud of you Sanika, you inspire me!\nIf you’re looking to start your workout schedule - We follow https://www.cure.fit/ They have a mix of all kinds of no-equipment workouts (Strength and Conditioning, Boxing, Yoga, Dance fitness, HRX -Muscle endurance, Pilates) for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. You would never get bored!\nSo please keep working out! Do it for the right reasons. The journey matters more than the destination. Stay strong, healthy and safe!\n","permalink":"https://ankita-singh2608.github.io/blog/post-5/","tags":null,"title":"Millennial Fitness: What they don’t tell you about it!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I was talking to my childhood friend, who was sharing her recent MBA journey. We caught up after a long time and ended up discussing our favourite experience from last semester – yes you guessed it right, it’s all about negotiations. She mentioned how this course has helped her learn so much about both herself and others, on a deeper, thought-provoking level. I couldn’t agree more!\nWe negotiate with people, almost every single day. With our bosses, our colleagues, partners, parents, siblings, shopkeepers (don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you have never bargained in your life ever) and the list goes on. How many times have you entered into a conflict situation and didn’t know how to react or felt guilty about the way you did. We all deal with negotiations and conflicts frequently and yet do not know how to do it right. So this is all about a small reflection of my journey during this course.\nThis course is taught through role-plays and I must say, walking in someone else’s shoes, isn’t easy. Although, it was not surprising to know, despite role-plays, how much of our personal behaviours showed up in every situation.\nFor simplicity, I have trimmed down my learning into three aspects :\nUnderstanding yourself: Self-awareness isn’t a walk in the park!\nDuring this course, I had my own self-reflection journey. There are certain situations that made me uncomfortable. My mind automatically went into the fight or flight mode in those situations. I had to challenge my assumptions. During this course, preconceived notions about myself took a backseat. Only after finding out the real reason, why I behaved or acted in a certain way, I could understand myself a little better. Conflicts made me uncomfortable. Although, there were layers to it. One of the sessions made me realize there was a childhood story behind it, that influenced my actions. And it wasn’t an easy one to identify. Only after addressing them, I could deal better with conflicts during negotiations. All I could say, I am much more aware now and still learning about myself.\nThis is the part where you need to do the most amount of homework before entering the negotiation room. You should be clear about your interests, and all the factors that drive you in life. What makes you uncomfortable? Why does it make you so uncomfortable? How do you react in those situations? What is your best alternative to a negotiated agreement? What is your mental and emotional state currently? If you look closely, you’ll find a pattern. Try identifying that pattern.\nUnderstanding others: Empathy isn’t a bad thing during negotiations after all!\nThis is the part where you stop obsessing with yourself and truly, genuinely make an attempt to understand the other person. Pay attention. To her words. To the voice modulation. To her body language. Her hand gestures. Figure out why this person is concerned about this deal (Yes, there are reasons beyond money that could matter). Only after you know even the unspoken terms of the deal, you could maybe, figure out a deal much more beneficial for everyone that you did not expect earlier. Who doesn’t like to get more than expected?\nA tip to know someone better: there are 6 basic human needs. Most of our motivation/ actions in life originates from the need to satisfy them. Figure out which ones drive them the most: Certainty, Uncertainty, Significance, Love and Connection, Growth or Contribution? If you don’t believe me, try out this mini-experiment: Guess 2 of the most relevant needs, from the above-mentioned list, of someone you know very well and cross-verify it with them. If you really do know them, it will all make sense.\nEnvironmental factors: A matter of behavioural design\nFor a better negotiation, it isn’t limited to human psychology but goes beyond. The environment you are in plays a major role. Consider a small, closed room in office vs an open area close to nature! In which situation would you find it easier to make a better deal, especially when you are exploring the possibilities of new ideas? One of the hacks that I learned: when you are negotiating, do you sit across the table and face each other? If so, for once, try sitting beside them in a way that both of you are facing in the same direction(not against each other). How is it significant? Oh well, one arrangement suggests – you both are faced with the same challenge and looking at solving it together while the other one suggests – you are in this situation against each other. I know you’re smart enough to guess which situation applies to which seating arrangement!\nThe most important thing I learnt in the first few sessions which were contradictory to my understanding of negotiation: there is, most of the times, an option that both parties win. And by winning, I mean everyone leaves the room with satisfaction. That is the definition of a successful negotiation. So the idea “it is a fixed-pie and I want the largest piece” isn’t helpful while negotiating. Always walk into the room with the mindset: “I could do the best, the best for both of us.” That being said, the most unexpected learning from this class was: how to give constructive feedback. But that’s a story saved for another journal!\nThis was just a very condensed glimpse of my journey through these amazing sessions! There was infinite learning, and if I started in detail, it would take unlimited pages to write them all down. If at all you get a chance to take a course in this field anywhere, please do. It’s something that is not limited to your personal or professional area of expertise. It is going to be handy in every aspect of your life.\nThank you, Barbara, for one of the most thoughtful, insightful and exciting courses of my MBA journey!\n","permalink":"https://ankita-singh2608.github.io/blog/post-4/","tags":null,"title":"MBA diaries: The art of negotiations and conflict resolutions"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I know I know, the title of this article made you yawn. If you’re both bored and guilty at the same time after seeing the word “routine”, you would probably gain some interesting insights. I promise to keep this as short and simple as possible! But before that, where did I draw my inspiration from about following a routine life? My mom isn’t the best reference when it comes to routine(sorry mum), but my papa and grand-dad(who is 75 years old) still wake up at 5 am and begin their days with an early morning workout before going to work. Crazy, isn’t it?\nInfluenced by Simon Sinek, let’s start with why it’s important to have a routine. Beginning with the most important one, time management. Yes, you now know that you have uninterrupted and highly focused 6-7 hours of work instead of spreading that all over your day until midnight(and sometimes beyond). You would now have dedicated hours for sleeping, eating and self-care “me-time”. Additionally, it offers you emotional stability. Routine makes you feel a lot more confident and focused. With a schedule, you could also help yourself avoid procrastination. All of these sum up to a positive feeling because you have neatly divided time for both Netflix and work. And this definitely contributes to your mental wellbeing.\nBut the point is, what should a routine look like and how to follow one? To be honest, the only reason I am able to follow my daily routine is because it\u0026rsquo;s simple. Do not complicate it by planning every single minute of your day. Instead, assign hours for every work. I divide my day into 4 different slots :\nMorning Mantra (8 am – 9 am)\nWake up at 8 am every day. (Yes, even on weekends!) Workout for 30-45 mins Breakfast @ 9 am\nWork Hours (9 am – 4 pm)\nSit and work on the table (yes it’s important to move out of bed) - Dedicate those 7 or 8 hours for work, in order of decreasing priority and energy needed for tasks. Lunch @ 1 pm (It’s important to have meals at the same time every day)\nHappy hours (4 pm – 11 pm)\nEvening snack @ 4 pm Do whatever you love! Dinner @ 7:30pm 8 pm – 11 pm: Much deserved Netflix time\nSleep hygiene(11 pm – 12 am)\nDay\u0026rsquo;s reflection or writing a journal for 5-10 mins. I prefer reading a book before sleeping instead of screen time. Sleep by @12 am.\nI strongly feel about routine because this helps me maintain sleep, food and work hygiene. It’s neat because, after late evening, I am not thinking about work anymore which helps me hit reset for the next day. Also, I know I am going to stay out of my comfort zone during those work hours, everything else in my routine from sleep to workout, helps me prepare for that time.\nTip: Getting in a schedule in one-go can be challenging, so I started with building with one slot a week initially. I began with practising sleep hygiene, and slowly implemented the rest.\nI would love to know how following a routine made a difference in your life.

Quarantine has forced me, to a great extent, to face uncomfortable thoughts and insecurities. The sudden change in the whole schedule of my daily life has led me to rethink about the direction I am headed and an element of fear led by uncertainty. Looking around, there’s panic, people are losing their jobs, businesses are struggling, and there’s a question if Class of 2020 is going to struggle to find their dream jobs?\nWell, those are situations and questions that cannot be answered in the present moment. Only because it is uncertain and the situation is beyond anyone’s control. When it comes to uncertainties, we are not very graceful and patient in handling them since we, as human beings always like to control all the situations as much as we can and prefer certainties. These uncertainties have raised a wave of insecure emotions within us that starts with an infinite number of unanswered questions.\nI still do not know the answer to those questions, but I would like to share a method that allows me to get comfortable with those uncertainties. I picked this concept a year ago from one of my favourite reads: “A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle”.\n  “Make peace with the present moment, accept it.” Most of our problems are tied to future made-up situations, which might not ever be true) and we are constantly dwelling in “What ifs”.\n  If you stop for a moment and ask yourself, “what is the problem I am facing in this very ‘present’ moment?” Most of the times it is None!\n  Once you realize that, practice gratitude for all that you have. (For starters, if you have food and a place to live, be grateful for that!)\n  Instead of wanting that moment to be any different from the way it is, which adds to more pain that is already there, is it possible for you to completely accept that this is what you feel right now? This consciousness empowers you.\n  The next step then is to do whatever you can do, after accepting the present moment without any judgements, in the best of your capacity. In my process, I am aware of the uncontrollable situations and acknowledge those uncertainties.\n  This has worked for me in the past! Give it a try, and do share if there are any practices you find particularly useful.\n","permalink":"https://ankita-singh2608.github.io/blog/post-2/","tags":null,"title":"Facing uncertainties"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Do you ever feel sometimes you’re owning more than required? Be it your thoughts or possessions, it is true for both worlds! In every aspect of life, we have a tendency to always look for more. We are never satisfied with what we already have which forces our mind to constantly lookout for more options and supposedly “better” alternatives. For example, we all have shoes or dresses we never even use them anymore, but still keep buying more because you are never satisfied with what you already have. While there’s no harm in owning more, but it is also important to let go of the stuff when they don’t serve us anymore before it clutters our space.\nWhy is it important to let go and how to do it?\u2028When we have so much, we often forget to appreciate what we have. To declutter your closet space and henceforth your mind, donate those clothes you don’t need anymore. Get rid of those office files or books that don’t serve you anymore. Sell off that furniture you don’t use. When you start with decluttering those physical objects, you allow your mind to declutter as well. It allows you to think more clearly, and focus on fewer important things you have rather than wasting energy on multiple thoughts running across your mind.\nAlert! Be sure not to get rid of things that you do need!! I suggested a few of my friends to try this and they ended up getting rid of things they needed! Please don’t be stupid!\nWant to know the benefits? Research has shown that, by letting go of excess stuff that doesn’t bring value to your life, helps you find clarity and boost productivity. It empowers you to appreciate what you have and promotes happy and healthy living. The physical space around us has the power to impact our emotional and physical well-being. Stay focused. Stay minimalistic. Isn’t it amazing how our environment has the power to influence our mental health?\n","permalink":"https://ankita-singh2608.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":null,"title":"Minimalism"}]
